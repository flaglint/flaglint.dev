title: Shared Client Architecture
description: Configure FlagLint for teams that import one shared OpenFeature client.

Mid-sized Node.js codebases usually initialize OpenFeature once and import a shared client into service files.

```text
platform/feature-flags.ts
  exports openFeatureClient

src/checkout.ts
  imports openFeatureClient
  calls openFeatureClient.getBooleanValue(...)
```

## Supported Binding Patterns

```ts
import { openFeatureClient } from "../platform/feature-flags.js";
```

```ts
import { openFeatureClient as flags } from "../platform/feature-flags.js";
```

```ts
const openFeatureClient = OpenFeature.getClient();
```

Aliased imports preserve the local identifier in dry-run and apply output.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "openFeatureClientBindings": [
    {
      "importName": "openFeatureClient",
      "modulePatterns": ["**/platform/feature-flags"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Ambiguous or unconfigured bindings are skipped. FlagLint does not guess that an arbitrary imported identifier is an OpenFeature client.
