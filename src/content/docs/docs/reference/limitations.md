FlagLint is intentionally narrow.

## Outside Detection Coverage

- Browser SDKs.
- React SDKs, hooks, and HOCs.
- Non-Node SDKs.
- Non-LaunchDarkly providers.
- Runtime-only flag key construction that cannot be resolved statically.

## Not Production Staleness Analysis

FlagLint does not query LaunchDarkly and does not identify production-stale flags. It cannot know flag age, owner, evaluation history, environment configuration, or production usage.

## Not Provider Bootstrap Automation

FlagLint does not insert provider setup files or remove LaunchDarkly dependencies. Existing LaunchDarkly dependencies remain needed while the LaunchDarkly OpenFeature provider is used.
