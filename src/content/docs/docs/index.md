description: Standardize LaunchDarkly Node.js server SDK evaluation calls on OpenFeature while keeping LaunchDarkly as the provider.

One command to understand your entire LaunchDarkly migration scope — before touching a line of code.

```bash
npx flaglint audit ./src
```

```text
✓ Audit complete: 13 flags — 3 high risk, 10 medium risk
```

No API key. No source upload. Runs locally against your checkout. LaunchDarkly stays your provider — OpenFeature becomes the evaluation API your application code calls.

## What FlagLint Does

- Performs local AST-based source analysis.
- Detects supported LaunchDarkly Node.js server-side evaluation calls from `@launchdarkly/node-server-sdk` and legacy `launchdarkly-node-server-sdk`.
- Generates inventory reports and reviewable migration plans.
- Applies only call-site rewrites with proven static inputs and a proven OpenFeature client binding.
- Emits validation SARIF with rule id `flaglint.direct-launchdarkly`.

## What FlagLint Does Not Do

- It does not replace LaunchDarkly. LaunchDarkly remains the provider.
- It does not generate provider/bootstrap files automatically.
- It does not query LaunchDarkly for flag age, owner, evaluation history, environment configuration, or production usage.
- It does not detect browser SDKs, React SDKs, non-Node SDKs, or non-LaunchDarkly providers.
